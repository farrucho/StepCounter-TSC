    "To achieve the target accuracy of 90% while minimizing the bit-width (size) of the accelerator, we selected the following configuration. For weights and activations we choose fp8_e4m3 (8-bit). We also evaluated int2, which performed worse (max accuracy was 86.20% with bfloat16, and much lower with fp formats). All 8-bit formats (int8, fp8_e4m3, fp8_e5m2) successfully exceeded 90%. We select fp8_e4m3 as it is the standard format for inference in the Microscaling specification (but other >90% accuracy combinations can be used). For elementwise operations we adopted fp8 (8-bit). We tested elementwise formats descending from bfloat16 down to fp8 and the results shown that the custom fp8 format (1 sign, 5 exponent, 2 mantissa) is sufficient. Even with this low precision, the network maintained high accuracy.\n",

    "3. Methodology:\n",
    "We performed a comprehensive grid search across all supported matrix multiplication and elementwise format combinations. We looked for the configuration that resulted in the lowest validation accuracy. While int2 generally performed poorly compared to 8-bit formats, this specific combination resulted in a complete model failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Comments on Notable Behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Guessing: Since the Fashion-MNIST dataset has 10 classes, an accuracy of 10.00% represents pure random guessing. The model completely failed to learn any distinguishing features of the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Unlearning\" / Divergence: It is notable that at Epoch 5, this configuration had an accuracy of 23.11%, but by Epoch 10, it collapsed to 10.00%. This behavior is characteristic of numerical divergence. The model likely encountered exploding gradients or accumulated numerical errors (NaNs) in the later epochs, destroying whatever small patterns it had initially learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instability of int2: The int2 format proved to be highly unstable. While it managed to achieve ~80% accuracy when paired with robust elementwise formats (like bfloat16), it collapsed when paired with the custom fp16 format. This highlights that extremely low-precision weights (int2) require high-precision accumulators and activations to remain stable; without them, training fails."
